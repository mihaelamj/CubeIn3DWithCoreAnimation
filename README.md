# CubeIn3DWithCoreAnimation

A demo of 3D cube done purely in Core Animation

It uses  [AllApples](https://github.com/mihaelamj/allapples) Swift package, to enable the example to work both on *iOS` devices ans well as on the *Mac*.

Well, that din't work out great, for I still have to make the Mac version to work correctly.

So on `iOS` and `iPadOS` it works as expected:

This is cube assembled.

There's also a flattened version:

The side number two is actually behin the side number 4.:
